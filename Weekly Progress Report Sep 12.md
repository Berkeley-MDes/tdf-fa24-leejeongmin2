## Week of 09/12/2024

This week, I explored Rhino and Grasshopper.

### Reflection

- I could understand the role of Grasshopper and how the algorithm works.
- However, I still don't fully grasp the types of algorithms and how they affect the models.
- I could experiment with changing parameters in the sample phone stand file.

### Speculations

I felt lost while exploring the features, and it's because I didn't have a certain goal (project) that I aimed to create. Next time, I will set a goal and plan to make it, then it could be much more feasible to learn this program.
