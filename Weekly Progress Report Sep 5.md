# Week 1: Example Report 1

## Week of 09/05/2024

This week, I learned how to use a laser cutting printer and printed a tea coaster for trial.

### Reflection

It takes multiple attempts to see the proper red outlines to cut through.

- **1st Attempt**: I put the line stroke as 0.01, and it didn't show up. The other student told me to change it to 0.001, but it still didn't appear.
- **2nd Attempt**: To figure out what the problem is, I just drew a simple square colored 255,0,0 and stroked 0.001px. Then the outline appeared. The problem is the pattern I made.
- **3rd Attempt**: I thought the problem was that the pattern layer and the outline overlapped, so I decreased the size of the pattern so that it did not overlap, and it still didn't work
- **4th Attempt**: I rasterized and expanded the pattern layer before, but I didn't expand it as a vector after masking it. So I made it sure to be fully vectorized. Then it finally worked.

### Speculations

It was so fun to try new equipment that I had never used before. This time, I focused on learning how to use it, which took more time than I expected. I would love to test other cutting settings like etching and more complex features.

# Week of 09/12/2024
This week, I explored Rhino and Grasshopper and developed some ideas for my computational design project.

## Reflection
I could understand the role of Grasshopper and how the algorithm works.
However, I still don't fully grasp the types of algorithms and how they affect the models.
I could experiment with changing parameters in the sample phone stand file.

Also, I started thinking of the object for project 1. Since I tried laser cutting last week, I am excited to try it again. Based on last week's reflection, I will make a helpful, structural object.

## Speculations
(about grasshopper)
I felt lost while exploring the features, and it's because I didn't have a certain goal (project) that I aimed to create. Next time, I will set a goal and plan to make it, then it could be much more feasible to learn this program.

(about laser cutting)
I made some diagrams aligned with the user's context and pain points, including plans to make the object.
I decided to make a headphone stand reflecting my daily life as a user.
