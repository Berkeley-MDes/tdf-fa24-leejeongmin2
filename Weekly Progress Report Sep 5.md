# Week 1: Example Report 1

## Week of 09/05/2024

This week, I learned how to use a laser cutting printer and printed a tea coaster for trial.

### Reflection

It takes multiple attempts to see the proper red outlines to cut through.

- First Attempt: I put the line stroke as 0.01, and it didn't show up. The other student told me to change it to 0.001, but it still didn't appear.
- Second Attempt: To figure out what the problem is, I just drew a simple square colored 255,0,0 and stroked 0.001px. Then the outline appeared. The problem is the pattern I made.
Third Attempt: I thought the problem was that the pattern layer and the outline overlapped, so I decreased the size of the pattern so that it did not overlap, and it still didn't work
- Third Attempt: I rasterized and expanded the pattern layer before, but I didn't expand it as a vector after masking it. So I made it sure to be fully vectorized. Then it finally worked.

### Speculations

It was so fun to try new equipment that I had never used before. This time, I focused on learning how to use it, which took more time than I expected. I would love to test other cutting settings like etching and more complex features.
