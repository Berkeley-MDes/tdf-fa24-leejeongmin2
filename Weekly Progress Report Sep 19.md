# Week of 09/19/2024
I made a final prototype of my headphone stand and tried out 3d printing.
Also, I completed deliverable video for my cohorts showcasing my journey with this project.

## Reflection

This week, I put in a lot of work to meet my project submission deadline. 
First, I transferred the headphone stand sketch from last week into Adobe Illustrator and laser-cut it. Installing it at home, I was pleased with the result. However, realizing that it also couldn't keep my sunglasses in place, I added a sunglasses hanger and remade the stand.

I recorded a lot of video footage of this process to share in class and edited it using Adobe Premiere Pro.

## Speculations

This week’s project work, from designing a headphone stand to adapting it into a multifunctional piece, 
focused on the essence of practical design. 

Initially, the stand was meant only for headphones, but adding a sunglasses hanger revealed how each iteration responds to new needs. 
Sharing the process through video deepened my understanding, turning a simple project into a dynamic exploration of form and function. 
It makes me wonder—could this be the start of more versatile designs that adapt to everyday life in unexpected ways?
