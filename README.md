# Github Background Information & Context
If you‚Äôre new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that‚Äôs hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it‚Äôs super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link!  As a start, feel free to simply add images to the `/assets` folder, which is located [here](/assets). 

The specific file that I‚Äôm typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (üí° TIP: The .md indicates that we‚Äôre using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (üí° TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis üòÑ</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the ‚Äúfront page‚Äù of your GitHub repo. This is where we‚Äôll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/24f-desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions#weekly-progress-report). They might look something like this: ###

# Week of 09/05/2024

This week, I learned how to use a laser cutting printer and printed a tea coaster for trial.

### Reflection

It takes multiple attempts to see the proper red outlines to cut through.

- First Attempt: I put the line stroke as 0.01, and it didn't show up. The other student told me to change it to 0.001, but it still didn't appear.
- Second Attempt: To figure out what the problem is, I just drew a simple square colored 255,0,0 and stroked 0.001px. Then the outline appeared. The problem is the pattern I made.
Third Attempt: I thought the problem was that the pattern layer and the outline overlapped, so I decreased the size of the pattern so that it did not overlap, and it still didn't work
- Third Attempt: I rasterized and expanded the pattern layer before, but I didn't expand it as a vector after masking it. So I made it sure to be fully vectorized. Then it finally worked.

### Speculations

It was so fun to try new equipment that I had never used before. This time, I focused on learning how to use it, which took more time than I expected. I would love to test other cutting settings like etching and more complex features.

# Week of 09/12/2024
This week, I explored Rhino and Grasshopper and developed some ideas for my computational design project.

## Reflection
I could understand the role of Grasshopper and how the algorithm works.
However, I still don't fully grasp the types of algorithms and how they affect the models.
Currently, I‚Äôm teaching myslef Blender, and I made a donut model to try printing in 3d. I'm going to try printing it in 3D next week.

Also, I started thinking of the object for project 1. Since I tried laser cutting last week, I am excited to try it again. Based on last week's reflection, I will make a helpful, structural object.

## Speculations
(about grasshopper)
I felt lost while exploring the features, and it's because I didn't have a certain goal (project) that I aimed to create. Next time, I will set a goal and plan to make it, then it could be much more feasible to learn this program.

(about laser cutting)
I made some diagrams aligned with the user's context and pain points, including plans to make the object.
I decided to make a headphone stand reflecting my daily life as a user.

# Week of 09/19/2024
I made a final prototype of my headphone stand and tried out 3d printing.
Also, I completed a deliverable video for my cohorts showcasing my journey with this project.

## Reflection

This week, I put in a lot of work to meet my project submission deadline. 
First, I transferred the headphone stand sketch from last week into Adobe Illustrator and laser-cut it. Installing it at home, I was pleased with the result. However, realizing that it also couldn't keep my sunglasses in place, I added a sunglasses hanger and remade the stand.

I recorded a lot of video footage of this process to share in class and edited it using Adobe Premiere Pro.

## Speculations

This week‚Äôs project work, from designing a headphone stand to adapting it into a multifunctional piece, 
focused on the essence of practical design. 

Initially, the stand was meant only for headphones, but adding a sunglasses hanger revealed how each iteration responds to new needs. 
Sharing the process through video deepened my understanding, turning a simple project into a dynamic exploration of form and function. 
It makes me wonder‚Äîcould this be the start of more versatile designs that adapt to everyday life in unexpected ways?

# Week of 09/26/2024

## Mapping Interaction Ecosystems

### Entertainment & Media Ecosystems

**First,** I checked my screen time to see which apps I use frequently and to understand their categories.

![IMG_6741](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36c8c0f3-a36f-4520-bb97-35855c08e0fc)

**Next**, I considered the purpose of my app usage and how I use them, dividing these two factors into the x and y axes to create a positioning map.
- X: Informational <-> Entertainment
- Y: Social (connecting with other people) <-> Content Consuming (not connecting other people, just consuming other's content)

<img width="1316" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-26 at 1 12 24‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc193914-ee5a-45df-bcad-8e8331ab993e">


**Last**, I reclassified the purposes of my app usage once more. I identified that the flow of obtaining, consuming information, and interacting with others is connected linearly, and I organized how this flow operates.

1. I obtain official information about school and job-related matters through Slack, WhatsApp cohort group chats, and LinkedIn. I mainly get information about official events from the school or companies, internship opportunities, exhibitions, and competitions.

2. If the information from step 1 is insufficient or if I need others' opinions or additional comments on that information, I turn to Reddit for further insights. At this stage, extra information is added to the formal information obtained earlier, creating a flow where the overall amount of information increases.

3. I gather a mix of official and unofficial information through platforms like X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, and YouTube. This information is often entertainment-oriented, helping me relieve stress or stay updated on social trends.

4. I process the information obtained from steps 1, 2, and 3 and engage in conversations with others, using this as a means of social networking. Others also go through similar steps, and there‚Äôs a flow where we exchange the information we've gathered from these processes.
