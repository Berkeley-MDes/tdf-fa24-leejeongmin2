# Github Background Information & Context
If you‚Äôre new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that‚Äôs hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it‚Äôs super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link!  As a start, feel free to simply add images to the `/assets` folder, which is located [here](/assets). 

The specific file that I‚Äôm typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (üí° TIP: The .md indicates that we‚Äôre using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (üí° TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis üòÑ</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the ‚Äúfront page‚Äù of your GitHub repo. This is where we‚Äôll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/24f-desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions#weekly-progress-report). They might look something like this: ###

# Week 1: Example Report 1

## Week of 09/05/2024

This week, I learned how to use a laser cutting printer and printed a tea coaster for trial.

### Reflection

It takes multiple attempts to see the proper red outlines to cut through.

- First Attempt: I put the line stroke as 0.01, and it didn't show up. The other student told me to change it to 0.001, but it still didn't appear.
- Second Attempt: To figure out what the problem is, I just drew a simple square colored 255,0,0 and stroked 0.001px. Then the outline appeared. The problem is the pattern I made.
Third Attempt: I thought the problem was that the pattern layer and the outline overlapped, so I decreased the size of the pattern so that it did not overlap, and it still didn't work
- Third Attempt: I rasterized and expanded the pattern layer before, but I didn't expand it as a vector after masking it. So I made it sure to be fully vectorized. Then it finally worked.

### Speculations

It was so fun to try new equipment that I had never used before. This time, I focused on learning how to use it, which took more time than I expected. I would love to test other cutting settings like etching and more complex features.
